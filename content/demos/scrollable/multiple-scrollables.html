  Here is another innovative way of scrolling images. Click on the
  images to see it in action. Use the <strong>left/right keys</strong>
  to navigate between images within a single scrollable:

<h3>HTML coding</h3>

<p>
  Here is a setup for a single scrollable. You can have as many of
  these on your page as you want.
</p>

{% filter syntax('html') %}
  <!-- scroll #1 -->
  <div class="scroll">
    <div class="pics">
      <div style="background-image:url(my-image-01.jpg)"></div>
      <div style="background-image:url(my-image-02.jpg)"></div>
      <div style="background-image:url(my-image-03.jpg)"></div>
    </div>
  </div>
{% endfilter %}

<h3>CSS coding</h3>

<p>
  Here is our CSS code. Nothing really special here. Scrollables are
  placed side by side with the <samp>float: left</samp> setting. We
  have a separate CSS block for the activated scrollable item that can
  be styled.
</p>

{% filter syntax('css') %}
{{ standalone.css_excerpt }}
{% endfilter %}

<h3>JavaScript coding</h3>

<p>
  Here we enable our scrollables. All scrollables have
  the <samp>circular</samp> configuration option set
  to <samp>true</samp> so that there is no beginning or end. We also
  add a custom click handler which seeks the scrollable forward using
  the <samp>next()</samp> method of
  the <a href="{{ content_url('scrollable/index.html') }}#api">Scrollable API</a>.
</p>
