<p>
  This demo shows how you can add custom effects to tabs. Here you can
  see a slight background color change when the sliding effect occurs:
</p>

<div style="width:280px;margin:25px auto;height:300px">
  {{ standalone.body }}
  <script>
    {{ standalone.effect }}
  </script>
</div>

<h3>Adding a custom effect</h3>

<p>
  If you want to make custom effects, you'll use
  the <samp>$.tools.tabs.addEffect()</samp> method. The first argument
  is the effect name and the second argument is the function that
  performs the required functionality when a tab (or accordion header)
  is clicked. You can use this method to modify existing effects or
  add new ones. Here we modify the built-in "slide" effect:
</p>

{% filter syntax('js') %}
{{ standalone.effect }}
{% endfilter %}

<p>
  Your effect function is given two arguments. The first
  argument, <samp>i</samp>, refers to the tab index number and the
  second argument, <samp>done</samp>, is a function that you <em>must
  call</em> after your effect finishes its job. This can be
  accomplished by calling <samp>done.call();</samp> .
</p>

<h3>JavaScript coding</h3>

<p>
  After we have modified our effect, the accordion installation is
  identical to our <a href="accordion.html">basic installation</a>:
</p>

{% filter syntax('js') %}
{{ standalone.js }}
{% endfilter %}
