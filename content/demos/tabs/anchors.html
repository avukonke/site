<p>
  You can load the page so that a specific tab is initially
  opened. This happens by naming the tabs and opening the page
  so that the name is given in the URL's anchor. When this page
  is opened, the second tab is initially opened. Look for the
  URL which has the anchor <samp>#second</samp>.
</p>

{{standalone.js}}

<p>
  As you can see, the panes have regular anchor links. If those anchor
  links match the names of the tabs, those tabs are automatically
  opened.

<h3>HTML coding</h3>

<p>
  Look for the tab names in the <samp>href</samp> attribute and those
  links inside the panes:
</p>

{% filter syntax('html') %}
{{ standalone.body }}
{% endfilter %}

<p>
  Tab construction is identical to the <a href="index.html">minimal
  setup</a>. There is nothing special here.
</p>

{% filter syntax('js') %}
{{ standalone.js }}
{% endfilter %}
