<p>
  It is possible to place HTML elements in front of the Flash movies
  to prevent the Flash from showing through. This is achieved by
  setting the <samp>wmode</samp> property to <samp>opaque</samp>. Then
  the Flash object can accept placement and positioning like any other
  element including the the <samp>z-index</samp> CSS property. Here is
  an example:
</p>

{{ standalone.body }}

<p>
  This feature does not work on Linux and in early versions of Opera,
  but browser support is still quite good.

<h3>JavaScript setup</h3>

<p>
  This is our JavaScript setup:
</p>

{% filter syntax('js') %}
{{ standalone.js }}
{% endfilter %}

<p>
  You can find a standalone version of this
  example <a href="wmode.htm">here</a>.
