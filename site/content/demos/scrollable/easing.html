{% block demo %}
<p>
  It is possible to alter scrollable's animation style or so-called
  "easing". Scroll through the following items and you can see it in
  action:
</p>

<div style="margin:20px -15px">
  {{ standalone.body }}
</div>

<br clear="all" />

<h3>Custom animation</h3>

<p>
  You can add new animations to the scrollable by adding them to
  the <samp>jQuery.easing</samp> object. Here we add one animation
  called "custom":
</p>

{% filter syntax('js') %}
{{ standalone.easing }}
{% endfilter %}

<p>
  As you can see the animation code is not for sane people. I grabbed
  this function from
  the <a href="http://gsgd.co.uk/sandbox/jquery/easing/"
  class="external">jQuery Easing Plugin</a>'s
  <a href="http://gsgd.co.uk/sandbox/jquery/easing/jquery.easing.1.3.js"
  class="external">source code</a>. There are quite a lot of different
  algorithms that you can try. This same library is being used by the
  jQuery UI project as well.
</p>

<h3>Scrollable setup</h3>

<p>
  The scrollable setup is simple. You configure the custom easing with
  the <samp>easing</samp> property. We can also change the easing
  speed with the <samp>speed</samp> property. Here we made it a little
  slower so that the animation is more visible.
</p>

{% filter syntax('js') %}
{{ standalone.js }}
{% endfilter %}


<div class="box petrol">
  Take a look at a <a href="easing.htm">standalone version</a> of this
  demo. View its source code to get things going on your page.
</div>

<h3>Changing the easing of an existing scrollable</h3>

<p>
  You can dynamically change the easing settings for an existing scrollable:
</p>

{% filter syntax('js') %}
  // get handle to the configuration
  var conf = $("#tab_panes").scrollable().getConf();

  // alter the easing
  conf.easing = 'custom';
  conf.speed = 700;
{% endfilter %}
