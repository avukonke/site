{% block demo %}
<p>
  These tabs combine the power of the history plugin and the AJAX
  effect. Notice that you can build your website's global navigation
  like this and it will also behave well on those browsers that do not
  support JavaScript at all!
</p>

{{standalone.body}}

<h3>HTML Coding</h3>

<p>
  We use anchor links (starting with <samp>#</samp>) on the tabs so
  that the history feature will work:
</p>

{% filter syntax('html') %}
{{ standalone.tabs }}
{% endfilter %}

<h3>JavaScript coding</h3>

<p>
  We use the <samp>history</samp> plugin together with
  the <samp>ajax</samp> effect:
</p>

{% filter syntax('js') %}
{{ standalone.js }}
{% endfilter %}

<div class="box petrol">
  Take a look at a <a href="ajax-history.htm">standalone version</a>
  of this demo. View its source code to get things going on your page.
</div>
